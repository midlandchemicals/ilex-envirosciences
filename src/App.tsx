            This website and its owners through their social media platform
            accounts may share web links to relevant web pages. By default some
            social media platforms shorten lengthy URLs. Users are advised to
            take caution and good judgement before clicking any shortened URLs
            published on social media platforms by this website and its owners.
            Despite the best efforts to ensure only genuine URLs are published,
            many social media platforms are prone to spam and hacking and
            therefore this website and its owners cannot be held liable for any
            damages or implications caused by visiting any shortened links.
